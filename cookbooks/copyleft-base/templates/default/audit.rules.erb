# RULE: Hosts File Change
# The rule below asks the audit system to watch for any write access
# or attribute change to the file /etc/hosts and log them to the audit
# log with the custom key string specified by us â€” hosts_file_change

-w /etc/hosts -p wa -k hosts_file_change


# RULE: Sysconfig Access
# The rule below will add a watch to the directory /etc/sysconfig and all
# files and directories beneath it for any read, write, or attribute change
# access. It will also label log messages with a custom key sysconfig_access.
